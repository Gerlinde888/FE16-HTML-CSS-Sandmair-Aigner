What is the purpose of semantic elements in HTML5?

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <img> - Clearly defines its content.
HTML5's semantic elements help structure the code we create, making it more readable and easier to maintain. 
They help us think about the structure of our dynamic data, and to choose titles' hierarchy properly. 
They help us differentiate the semantic elements of our markup from the ones we use solely for layout.
